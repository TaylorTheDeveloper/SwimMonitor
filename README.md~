How to use:

1. Make sure you have openCV installed. I'm using version 2.4.9.
2. colorFilter.cpp
	* Run ./build.sh
	* Then ./colorFilter

3. colorFilter.py
	* Run python colorFilter.py

Currently, both of these programs attempt to do the same thing. The Python version runs much faster than the CPP version, however, it's not as accurate.`
